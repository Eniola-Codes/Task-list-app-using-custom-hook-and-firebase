# Description

**Details**

My task list application is used to set activities which you would love to do in the future.

The application takes on a single input from the user which is the task 

![Form](https://github.com/Eniola-Codes/Task-list-app-using-custom-hook-and-firebase/blob/Main/src/assets/taskform.png?raw=true)

On the other hand, when you submit a valid value, an item is added to the item list

**Technologies**

Technologies i used to build this are React.js, css and firebase

I used React.js framework to bootstrap this project because of the below functionalities : 

- Seperation of concerns (Having leaner files and components by breaking down the code into smaller parts)
- Prop drilling to pass some data from component to component with ease.
- Css modules which prevent clashing of classnames around components therefore avoiding unwanted results

# Installation and Running

git clone or pull the project using your terminal, open the project folder on your local laptop in a code editor and run "npm start" in your editors terminal.
